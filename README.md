Spectral-Spatial Nearest Subspace Classifier for Hyperspectral Image Classification

This demo implements the Spectral-Spatial Nearest Subspace Classifier for
Hyperspectral Image Classification [1]

More details in paper:
[1]

The proposed method analyzes the closeness between two subspaces, where one subspace is the space spanned 
by the neighborhood of the test sample and the other subspace is the space spanned by the withinclass training samples. 
The proposed method is simple, parameter-free, easy to implement and has a closed-form solution.
